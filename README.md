IDEA: The Developer Availability Dashboard is a straightforward and user-friendly application designed for 21n to monitor developers workload and availability in real time. Team members can use it to indicate their present status, such as available, occupied, or on leave, and they can also choose to discuss how they're feeling about their work. This facilitates more effective resource planning and allows project managers to quickly determine who is prepared for work allocation. The platform promotes rapid updates and team transparency, which improves cooperation and workflow.
